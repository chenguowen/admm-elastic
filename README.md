# NOTE

This code is a bit outdated and I'll be modifying it to include material from our recent [IEEE TVCG paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7990052). Also, I believe there to be some bugs. If you plan to use this code for comparison, I ask that you please wait little while for me to fix up some issues.

# abstract

We apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization algorithm to implicit time integration of elastic bodies, and show that the
resulting method closely relates to the recently proposed projective dynamics algorithm. However, as ADMM is a general-purpose optimization algorithm applicable
to a broad range of objective functions, it permits the use of nonlinear constitutive models and hard constraints while retaining the speed, parallelizability, and
robustness of projective dynamics. We demonstrate these benefits on several examples that include cloth, collisions, and volumetric deformable bodies with nonlinear elasticity.

# installation

The best way to include admm-elastic in your project is to include it in another directory,
use cmake to call add_subdirectory, then use the ${ADMME_LIBRARIES} and
${ADMME_INCLUDE_DIRS} set as parent variables during the build.
